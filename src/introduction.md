# Introduction

Welcome to **Isaac: A Practice-First Guide to Isaac Sim**.

This book teaches NVIDIA Isaac Sim by doing. You'll run the simulator in the first chapter, control a robot in the third, and build understanding progressively as concepts become necessary.

## What is this book?

This is not a tutorial collection or API reference. This is a **systems book** that teaches you:
- How to build working simulations quickly
- How Isaac Sim actually works (when that knowledge becomes necessary)
- How to diagnose and fix problems systematically
- How to scale from prototype to production

## Who is this book for?

- **Roboticists** integrating Isaac Sim with existing robot stacks
- **ML Engineers** training policies or generating synthetic data
- **Graphics/Simulation Engineers** coming from USD/Omniverse backgrounds

## How this book is organized

**Parts I–IV** get you productive: running the simulator, building scenes, modeling robots, configuring sensors.

**Part V** explains the execution model—introduced only after you've hit the bugs it causes.

**Parts VI–VIII** cover integration, synthetic data, and robot learning.

**Parts IX–X** bring everything together for production systems.

**Appendices** provide quick reference material.

## Quick Start

Open [Launching Isaac Sim](./getting-started/01-launching-isaac-sim.md) and follow along. You'll be controlling a robot within an hour.
